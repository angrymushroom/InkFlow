feat: chapters sidebar, outline UX, and getScenes storage fix

- Add left navigation sidebar: chapters and scenes with links to Write
- Outline: inline scene cards under chapters; add-scene creates scene immediately
- Chapter/scene click navigates to Write; scene cards have Write/Edit/Delete
- Fix getScenes() to sort in memory (avoid Dexie compound index)
- useOutline composable for shared chapters/scenes; OutlineView/WriteView use it
- Locales: nav.chapters, noChapters, goToOutline, outline.writeScene
- Sidebar: responsive layout, mobile overlay with toggle
